Everything went well overall until bob talked about his wife, then it upset Carol because she thought bob and her had a thing, but in reality bob was just being a nice person to her. She got upset hearing about bobs wifes meat loaf. In  rage, she forgot to pull from main before raging about Bob having a waifu in her own branch. Without even thinking about the merge conflicts she was about to create, she pushed it up to github and made a pull request. This did not work out, but Bob, Ted, and Alice all went through and made sure to resolve the merge conflicts and got it merged with the main branch. In the end all the code worked out no thanks to Carol.
